In this proposal, I aim to create in-video quizzes and video analytics for FST 1000, a PolyX FYE course to better engage my students through a learn-by-doing approach. Interactive in-video quizzes will be created through both Canvas Learning Management System and Kaltura. Both platforms will be compared for their advantages and disadvantages when creating in-video quizzes. Then, video analytics will be developed through Camtasia software to allow automatic grading to be assigned to students based on the percentage of a video students have watched. Two workshops will also be organized to discuss with faculties who are interested in these technologies to revamp their virtual courses. With these efforts, I am confident that FYE students will be better motivated to participate in their FYE courses and are better engaged in immersive virtual learning experience. Most importantly, interactive in-video quizzes will allow long-time retention of the important concept within a course instructors aim to convey. For example, I aim to create a thorough academic advising video and imbed in-video questions. This will allow my FST students to constantly remind themselves about the academic advising plans for the next couple of years in Cal Poly Pomona.",

            "abstract": "We are applying for the SPICE grant to establish a streamlined digital environment with software and cloud service and develop a comprehensive instructional framework to support the teaching and learning of Big Data (BD), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) technologies and their innovative applications in environmental design. Through this proposal, we aim to (1) better prepare students with the latest technologies and tools for the capturing, processing, and analyzing of big geospatial data, such as high-resolution remote sensing images and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data collected with various sensors mounted on spaceborne, airborne, and uninhabited remote sensing platforms; (2) introduce students to big data in various formats, including texts, sounds, photos, videos, etc., that documents the biophysical and socio-behavior phenomena involved in environmental design decision-making, and (3) expose students to the cutting edge knowledge, skills, and tools of AI and ML and their applications in solving environmental and social problems such as climate change crisis, ecological degradation, and environmental and social injustice through learning, research, and practice. With support from the SPICE grant, we will mentor students in the research and discovery of emerging information challenges in the big data era, facilitate collaboration among students to conduct service-learning projects that involve local, regional, and global communities, provide equal access to centralized computation powers and software environment, and offer inclusive accommodation of students with demands for flexible learning modalities and schedules. In short, our project provides students with cutting-edge information technologies and enables them to generate creative and innovative solutions to critical societal problems through learn-by-doing activities in highly flexible learning modes. \r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nThe funding will cover the cost of big geospatial data software applications, such as Trimble eCognition and Pix4D bundle, software development tools, such as those from Jetbrains, and subscription credit for mainstream cloud servers with AI and ML capacities, such as those from Amazon and Microsoft. Most of the funding will pay for perpetual software licenses, while a small portion covers service credits for periodical subscriptions. That said, while the BD-AI-ML program will mainly serve students in the College of Environmental Design, it will be open to students on the entire campus through the GIS minor program or open electives. In this way, thousands of students in different programs and colleges can be benefited from the investment. The BD-AI-ML program and relevant contents will be directly integrated into current courses such as LA3581/5582 Geodesign Fundamentals for Environmental Designers, LA6111L Design for Change studios, LA6441 Plant and Ecology, LA4782 Evolving Issues in Environmental Design, LA5581 Visual Communication for Design, and indirectly involved in many other courses in the College. After the pilot stage, it can become a stand-alone course to teach students about BD-AI-ML in environmental design. It may also lead to a new certificate or degree program in environmental design with big data in the future. The applicants are faculty members with robust digital and geospatial technologies and big data backgrounds and have many years of experience teaching computer technologies. We are confident of achieving great success within the classroom, participating in the Signature Polytechnic Experiences (PolyX), and generating scholarly publications related to BD-AI-ML in environmental design education. In conclusion, the support from the SPICE grant will provide critical software and network infrastructure for this effort and make a big difference in filling in the current gap that students have little access to the latest software and network resources and lack learning experience that directly connects them to AI and ML technologies in the context of environmental design.",

The course will be laboratory intense and consist of 2 hours of lecture and 2 laboratory sessions per week. In this course, students will learn the theory and application of diverse techniques in molecular biology and cell biology.

            "abstract": "Project-based learning (PBL) and active faculty-to-student and student-to-student interactions are important components of enhanced effective learning. Project-based learning in engineering courses involves embedding assignments, individual and group work deliverables which are projects based on real-world engineering projects. Students need to practice how to frame a problem, identify stakeholders and their needs, list design requirements, select theoretical concepts, define feasible alternatives, select best practices (BPâs), develop a detailed design, consider engineering economy, and present/communicate the outcomes. Project-based leaning involve discovery, addressing challenges in the field, collaboration and teamwork, involvement with the community, and intense mentoring. Project-based learning is aligned with some of the âessential elementsâ of PolyX identify particularly âCollaborative learningâ and âCritical thinking and problem solvingâ. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this SPICE proposal is to reinvigorate the learning experience for students in the Civil Engineering (CE) department by re-inventing the conventional CE-3201: Environmental Engineering course. CE-3201 is a lecture course that is a required core course for the Environmental Engineering option students in the Civil Engineering undergraduate degree and a technical elective course for all Civil Engineering department students. Based on the data from Tableau, there is a performance gap between Underrepresented Minority (URM) students and non-URM students in CE-3201 course. The PI of this SPICE proposal is the course-coordinator for CE-3201. Currently, CE-3201 is offered in a conventional way of offering a lecture course with emphasis on theoretical concepts and traditional lecture-based mode. Project-based learning, teamwork strategies, and mechanisms that are envisioned in this SPICE proposal would enhance teaching and learning in flexible learning modalities as team projects and collaborative work in engagement with the community are usually activities that occur out the classroom environment and would support flexible learning modalities. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental crises are becoming the grand challenges for the current century. The learning objectives of CE-3201 are focused on the proven engineering methods to deal with scientifically known environmental challenges. There are new and emerging engineering understandings and approaches to the ongoing environmental challenges in the technical community. Hence, there is an immense need to integrate these new approaches as defined projects into the course syllabus and reinvigorate the content of CE-3201 course to implement PBL practices. \r\n\r\nThis SPICE project will emphasize on the existing learning objectives of CE-3201 lecture course and reinvigorate the content of the course by implementation of PBL methods. The specific objectives of this project are to introduce: 1) innovative and up-to-date project-based learning (PBL) activities, 2) intense mentorship via mentor-mentee and peer-to-peer interactions, and 3) global and community engagement with meaningful interactions with local/national agencies and consulting firms. Innovative PBL activities will include concepts related to global water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, greenhouse effect phenomenon, climate change, carbon sequestration methods, renewable energy, water recycling concepts, water reclamation engineering, low impact development (LID) practices, integrated solid waste management, waste recycling engineering, and pollution prevention. Students will be exposed to a few projects that offer real-world problems, along with the complexity and uncertainty of factors that influence such problems. Hands-on projects will be defined based on the above-listed topics to reinforce the learning objectives of the course. Effective sustainable instruments, such as development of memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreements between the college of engineering and local agencies, are being planned to sustain the project-based learning practices in the course. These mechanisms would enhance participation of professionals in the classroom as invited speakers, class-project co-advisers, or judges for the course symposium day. Students who take this course will have a better learning experience and would be more prepared for the Californiaâs engineering job market. \r\n\r\nThis SPICE project impacts a large number of engineering students, as the Civil Engineering B.S. program at Cal Poly Pomona is the largest civil engineering undergraduate program in the nation. Approximately, 110 students take CE-3201 course every year. All of them will directly benefit from the outcomes of this SPICE project. There are other courses in the Civil Engineering department that will be enhanced indirectly because of reinvigoration of this course via implementation of PBL practices. These courses include: CE 3211-Water Resources Engineering, CE 4241-Water Reclamation, CE 4201-Water and Wastewater Engineering, CE 4220-Solid and Hazardous Waste Engineering, and CE 4231-Water Reclamation and Desalination.",

The project will provide students in each class with an opportunity to strengthen the knowledge of how class, race/ethnicity, and gender identities are represented in games, and to apply the knowledge in the development of a playable game; in response to the call for gender and racial justice in games, students will create game narratives and characters and convert the ideas into a reality. Each PI will also hold 1-2 guest lectures in the respective other class; Dr. Hwang will speak about racial representations in video games and inclusive practices in digital media in CS 2990, and Dr. Eger will give a short introduction to the design and development of video games in IGE/EWS 2600. We have designed this project as a cross-disciplinary, multicultural and active-learning experience, closely aligned with CPPâs Signature Polytechnic Identity.",

Providing students with the means to actively interact with their local urban biodiversity, while empowering them to share their knowledge with the community, is an approach that not only enhances student learning and motivation but also provides critical connections between our campus and surrounding community. Bats are animals that are often misunderstood, but provide critical links between biodiversity and agriculture through their provision of ecosystem services. They are also an extremely widespread group of animals, and many species have adapted to live alongside humans in cities. This proposal aims to leverage the wonder of bat ecology, the fascinating world of urban biodiversity, and the excitement of students to engage with their community, to establish an ongoing student-led bat box monitoring and community outreach program. This program will be established through a co-curricular workshop led by international bat box and outreach expert, Dr Joy OâKeefe, and myself. Students will gain hands-on experiences as they build bat boxes (artificial bat roosts) for deployment on campus, while learning about bat ecology and outreach techniques so that they can share their knowledge with our community via outreach programs. The on-campus bat box monitoring stations will provide real urban ecology data for use in a variety of courses and undergraduate research projects within the Department of Biology and the College of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nReferences for document:\r\n\r\nAlvarez, E.N., Garcia, A., Le, P., 2022.

Industry, government and academia are turning to Data Scientists with the goal of improving business processes, public and social services, or understanding user behavior. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of data scientists will grow 36% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average rate of 5% for all occupations. Additionally, a recent survey by the Business-Higher Education Forum indicated that while 69% of employers would prefer job candidates with DS skills over the ones without it, only 23% of educators said their graduates will have DS and analytics skills. DS will be one of the top areas in which companies will face difficulty in finding enough candidates with the appropriate skill-set. The department of Computer Science currently offers a minor in Data Science, which helps students acquire some of these skills in a classroom setting, but for a more rounded profile, we should also offer extracurricular opportunities for practical applications, in the form of a student club and digital badges that students can use to prove their credentials. To fill this gap, this proposal outlines the design and implementation of a data science program through establishment of a student club (DS Club) and design and implementation of state-of-the-art digital badges as the assessment and recognition of studentsâ achievements. A digital badge is a visual representation of skills or knowledge one has gained and learned during a course or activity. It is a dynamic portable icon that is embedded with detailed information of the accomplishment, skill, quality or interest learned in different environments. Our program, named Data Science Pathway (DSP), will be fully aligned with the PolyX rubric, and will provide help students from a wide range of majors meet their career aspirations in the field. The student led and faculty mentored DS Club is planned to work in synergy with the digital badge initiatives as it will serve as a platform to hold several of the activities related to our badges. To enable its full implementation, an online management platform will be designed and implemented in Canvas to manage student accomplishments throughout the program. In addition, the issuance of digital badges for those who complete all DSP requirements will be done through a fully Canvas-integrated badging platform named Badgr. Finally, information on how this implementation will directly reflect on student progress, engagement, retention, and learning in the data science domain is also provided. We believe that the DSP program will serve to bring together faculty and students from majors from every single college on campus and be a catalyst for interdisciplinary collaboration for the development of innovative educational products and PolyX experiences in Data Science.",

Emerging, rigorous work in social psychology shows that these mindsets can change and that faculty play an important role in creating supportive environments. Many STEM instructors have not had the opportunity to learn about strategies to support student motivation. Goal 1 of is this proposal is to provide funding for STEM instructors to complete the online, asynchronous Motivating Learners Course (MLC), designed and developed by the Motivate Lab, housed at the University of Virginia and SDSU. This hands-on, virtual course equips faculty to kick off courses with motivationally-supportive activities to excite students, and explores ways to keep motivation levels high throughout the term. Participants learn about three key learning mindsetsâGrowth Mindset, Purpose & Relevance, and Sense of Belongingâand strategies for leveraging these mindsets in a way that promotes equity while being customized to their own courses, teaching methods, and styles of communication.\r\n\r\nAlthough this initial training in motivation is critical, it is equally important to keep the momentum going for faculty after the course is completed. Since Fall 2020, the MLC has been available to STEM faculty at CPP. At the end of spring 2023, 99 (!) instructors will have completed it. The Motivating Learners revolution at CPP is well underway. Goal 2 of this proposal is to create an ongoing motivation-focused teaching community for faculty in STEM to share successes, commiserate over challenges, and generate new ideas. To meet the range of faculty needs and interests, we will offer Informal âshare-a-thonâ gatherings on a monthly basis and a motivation-buddy system in which faculty will be paired with one or two other faculty who are MLC graduates. The small group would agree to meet 5 times throughout the year (on their own, for an hour or so each time) to share ideas, try new approaches, or discuss collected data.",

Unfortunately, the Construction Materials Laboratory (17-1676) cannot accommodate more than 20 students per laboratory section for a hands-on, in-person experience. As a result, the demand for this class always exceeds the department's ability to accommodate all students. Per semester, we normally offer 7 sections of lab and accommodate 140 students. There are usually an additional 20-30 students waitlisted across all CE2030/L sections (lab and lecture are co-requisites).\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced us into teaching remotely and the hands-on experience for CE 2030L Civil Engineering Lab was replaced with watching videos of the laboratory experiments and Zoom sessions. To counter the loss of the hands-on experience, in Dr. Andrei prepared for each student enrolled in CE2030L a take-home test kit that included an inexpensive kitchen scale, a ruler, and small samples of materials normally used in the lab experiments. Students were also provided with instructions on how to use the test kits to conduct, in the comfort of their home, small-scale experiments that illustrate the same concepts students would have learned in the lab from observing the large-scale experiments. At the end of the semester, students indicated via a brief survey that they found the test kits very useful in helping them understand the laboratory's concepts.\r\n\r\nBased on the Summer 2020 experience and results, we would like to further develop the take-home test kits for CE2030L and to produce accompanying written and video guidance materials with step-by-step instructions on how to conduct the tests and report the results.

            "abstract": "The subject of Supply Chain Management has become the focus of the industry and it is necessary for students to have the necessary skill sets in this area for the job market. This subject is being taught by the department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering (IME) to all undergraduate IME students (IME 3261) and all masters students in both graduate programs of the IME department (EMT 5730 in M.S. of Engineering Management and SE 5220 in M.S. of Systems Engineering). The subject of Supply chain Management has been consistently selected as the most useful subject by our alumni (via an online survey conducted annually by the department) and our Industry Advisory Council. To equip students with the necessary skills, a three-phase project was started more than two years ago to infuse active learning and flip learning methods into these classes. With the start of COVID-19, we adjusted our plan to accommodate different teaching modalities going forward. During the past four semesters, by dedicating a substantial amount of time and effort, we completed the first two phases of the project and deployed its outcomes to the courses. More specifically, we revised the topics, blended the topics with computer implementations, developed about 40 high-quality video lectures (avg of 10 minutes each), and designed 20 online quizzes/homework/tests of different sizes were organized into 9 modules to completely revamp the learning experience of students. Although it has only been one semester (Fall 2022) since the implementation of the first two phases, the feedback from students has been very positive. In this proposal, we will focus on the third phase of this project, providing a real-world learning experience to students in which they scale up the learning outcomes of the course to real-world projects that companies deal with in their operations. This is planned to become a series of in-class activities for the flipped offering of the course in both face-to-face and hybrid settings.\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nTo this end, we will equip each module with two major case studies in an innovative way. We begin each module with the âstoryâ of the module, encapsulated in a real-world case study and its datasets. A more complex case study will also be developed to provide students with an opportunity to synthesize and evaluate scenarios before developing solutions. The case studies will be used as in-class group activities to accommodate flip-learning. Each module ends with an assignment based on the same case studies and datasets in order to provide a hands-on experience for students using what they learned in the module. In this process, we collaborate with two academic and industry organizations to develop case studies that reflect the ongoing challenges of supply chain managers.",

The biggest challenge for incorporating lab activities in CE 2061 on our campus is the outdated and dysfunctional lab equipment in our Fluids Lab (Bldg.17, Rm.1628).

            "abstract": "It is not new to use simulators to teach sensing and control, as a supplement to hands-on practice on actual devices. The simulator can bypass the problems caused by practical reasons (most prominently, sensor noise from âcheapâ education sensors) and allow students to focus on advanced topics (e.g. autonomous navigation). With technological advancement, (especially computer-human interface improvement,) students are increasingly motivated by the feeling of immersion in the simulation and are not used to the traditional education simulators which usually include several GUI windows.\r\n\r\nWe propose an augmented reality (AR) simulator by Microsoft HoloLens for teaching measurement and control. Currently, the Mechanical Measurement course and the Introduction to control (ME4351 and ME4391, both required in the mechanical engineering program, with an annual enrollment approx. 300 students) do not have a simulator-based lab. Students are usually frustrated by hardware failure or inaccuracy of the sensor reading.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed task, an AR-based simulator is proposed to pilot the efforts on enhancing mechanical engineering studentsâ hands-on experience. Students in ME4351 (measurement) will design and experiment on an AR-simulated robotics dog to perform autonomous measurement activities. Based on an open-source walking dog design (SpotMicroAI dog), the proposed simulated robotics dog can be used for students to learn how to automatically measure temperature, velocity, acceleration, etc. on a mobile platform. In addition, students in ME4391 (control) will also be able to use the simulated robotics dog to perform fundamental autonomous control tasks. Through a series of proposed labs, students will review the advanced knowledge on how to process sensing data without frustration caused by the hardware. In addition, an AR-simulated walking dog robot platform, which is not used in any mechanical engineering course, will also motivate students in project-based learning.\r\n\r\nGiven the technical challenge, the project should be considered a pilot study using AR for improving the simulation experience. Further grants can be attracted from NSF-EDU program if our preliminary study shows the feasibility of applying AR-simulation for multiple engineering laboratories.",

Thus, accurate measures of various human movements, including the cause of our movement, are the essential stage of anything else in exercise science. We use a Biodex dynamometer in many of our exercise science courses at undergraduate and graduate levels (approximately 800 Kinesiology students in the Exercise Science track). This upgraded software allows students to gain a more advanced understanding of the various human movement and develop technical skills to identify problems or areas of improvement in rehabilitation process changes over time with intervention, such as with physical or occupational therapies. Additionally, KHP is currently in the development/building stage of a new 4200 sqft Exercise Science teaching laboratory. The upgraded Biodex system will be implemented in the new lab facility to enhance student learning in Kinesiology, especially in the foci of exercise science and health promotion. The Biodex system also is a research grade/validated tool in Kinesiology research and would be a valuable resource to encourage further student research.",

This proposal is aiming to develop a set of new courses which covers all the stack of gaming from designing hardware computer architecture courses for benchmarking the top five gaming consoles for 2022 (Playstation 5, Xbox one X, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, and Xbox Series X) and also involving the machine learning understanding for creating games for these platforms, which will open the door for creating startup companies for our new graduates and also preparing them for joining top-notch gaming companies in the country. Three faculty members (Dr. Mohamed Aly who is an expert in computer architecture and reconfigurable computing, Dr. Anas Salah Eddin who is an expert in machine learning and artificial intelligence and Dr. Halima El-Naga who is an expert in-memory architecture will work together for creating these courses and those PIs are requesting specialized consoles (mentioned above) for their preparation of these courses.",

            "abstract": "Mechatronics is the synergistic application of mechanics, electronics, control engineering, and computer science in the development of electromechanical products and systems, through integrated design. We intend to extend a typical mechatronics course beyond traditional engineering topics, and to modernize the mechatronics instructions with complementary quantum engineering topics. We have initially published this initiative in the American Society for Engineering Education Conference in 2021 with the title \"Modernizing Mechatronics course with Quantum Engineering\". With the recent rapid advances in quantum technologies such as quantum communications, sensing, computers, and algorithms, it is imperative that next generation of engineers be trained in quantum technologies, and prepare them for their future careers in the ever changing industry in such areas. Furthermore, due to such progress and advances in the fields associated with the applications of quantum mechanics, the integration of quantum technologies with classical mechanical systems will be inevitable both in terms of educational and technological standpoints in future. To address the educational needs of the future engineers in such areas of significant importance, quantum entanglement and quantum cryptography experiments, as two fundamental topics in quantum mechanics, are brought into the mechatronics course in an initiative including Quantum Entanglement, and Quantum Cryptography. The integrated quantum and mechatronics topics also provides opportunities on exploring the interface of quantum technologies and classical\r\nengineering systems, which can potentially push the engineering boundaries beyond classical\r\npossibilities by accessing and leveraging the quantum advantages. An innovative online remote demonstration of such quantum experiments is also developed and presented to the students. This course has already been offered to undergraduate students once with successful results. The students were able to both in-person and remotely access the experiments, perform the experiments and collect data. The successful result of such quantum experiments is also reflected in a course survey, presented here, even though the quantum mechanics topics offered in this course are unfamiliar to engineering students and hence more challenging. The aim is to promote, the integration of selected quantum technology topics with the mechatronics course for training engineering students in this rapidly growing area.\r\n\r\nTo further support the importance of the education of quantum mechanics in engineering we would like to refer to the following quotes and references:\r\n\r\nâQuantum Engineering should be established as a new discipline or a sub-discipline in engineering schools which requires developing curricula and textbooks both at undergraduate and graduate levels.â âfrom: THE WHITE HOUSE, NATIONAL QUANTUM COORDINATION OFFICE\r\n\r\nâthe Quantum Frontiers Report on Community Input to the Nationâs Strategy for Quantum Information Science outlines eight frontiers that contain core problems with fundamental questions confronting quantum information science (QIS) today. They include:\r\n\r\nâ¢ Expanding Opportunities for Quantum Technologies to Benefit Society\r\n\r\nâ¢ Building the Discipline of Quantum Engineering\r\n\r\nâ¢ Generating and Distributing Quantum Entanglement for New Applications\r\n\r\nâ¢ Understanding the Universe through Quantum Informationâ\r\n\r\nâThese frontier areas, identified by the QIS research community, are priorities for the government, private sector, and academia to explore in order to drive breakthrough R&D.â\r\n\r\nâOnly a small number of scientific techniques and technological applications take advantage of the unique phenomena of quantum superposition and entanglement.â\r\n\r\nâThe global quantum effort is continually rising with worldwide investments in quantum research and quantum technology reaching almost $25 billion.â, and the United States National Quantum Initiative budget $1.2 billion. \r\n\r\nâThe National Science Foundation shall:\r\n\r\naward grants for the establishment of Multidisciplinary Centers for Quantum Research and Education.â National Quantum Initiative Act.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that, as part of our continuous effort in updating and modernizing our laboratory experiments, and offering the latest emerging areas of engineering to our students, and in regards with the topic of this proposal, we recently performed the \"violations of the Bell inequalities\" test based on our existing quantum entanglement setup at Cal Poly Pomona. This is the experiment that John Clauser, Alain Aspect, and Anton Zeilinger performed. The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded to them for this work: \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science\".\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/summary/\r\n\r\nWe recently (in 2023) submitted a paper to the American Association of Engineering Education that explains this experiment, and how this experiment can be taught to the undergraduate engineering students as a laboratory exercise. Quantum entanglement experiment and the Bell inequality test (which both can be performed using the same experimental setup) demonstrate the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. These experiments show the fundamental difference between quantum and classical domains, which are essential in understanding quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nDr. Homeyra Sadaghiani from the physics department at Cal Poly Pomona, who is a co-PI in this proposal, is an expert in quantum mechanics. We collaborate and consultant with her on how the quantum experiments in this proposal could be used with the physics students or in upper division quantum courses and help with the surveying students /assessment aspect of the project.",

The laboratory course serves a majority of undergraduate students in the Civil Engineering Department, which currently has approximately 1,500 active enrolled students. By providing a hands-on experience, even in a remote environment, students will gain a better understanding of the behavior of structures. Moreover, they will have the foundational knowledge required to become a licensed Professional Engineer in any state.
